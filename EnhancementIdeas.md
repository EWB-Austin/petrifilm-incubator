Here a number of loose enhancement ideas:

* Don't try to run two heat boxes with one Arduino.  Make separate units.
* Try to run everything on 12 volt system, but allow multiple jacks to support parallel battery capabilities.
* Put the Arduino in the heat chamber to take advantage of the waste heat.
* Keep the batteries outside.
* Use and LCD shield to provide better status.
* Provide an audio and visual alarm when the temperature is out of spec for too long.
* 

# Idea: Build the thing into the cap of a thermos bottle.

# Idea: Make it something that essentiall "wraps around" a battery pack.


# Note: I have now created a printed circuit board for this purpose.

I have not yet tested it. It is shared at OSH Park as "Petrifilm Incubator Board" under this profile: https://oshpark.com/profiles/RobertLRead .

# Idea: Make an Arduino Shield Incubator.

This would be a little weird.  We could technically make a Shield for an Arduino. This coult possibly have a projection on a PCB to hold the petrifilms.  Above it we could place our LCD shield. The result would be a very small and elegant system for what we are doing.  We would have to provide insulation in some other manner.
