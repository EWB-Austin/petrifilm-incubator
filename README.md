# petrifilm-incubator
A low-cost, portable Petrifilm(TM) Incubator for doing in-country bacterial analysis of water quality for EWB.

## Problem

Engineers Without Borders does wonderful work providing better-quality water to under-developed communities. Essential
to this is water quality analysis. The 3M Petrifilm(TM) is a widely used way of assessing bacteria load. It requires that
inocultated films be incubated at precise temperatures. Generally, EWB works in communities that have no electrical grid.
The problem then is to reliably incubate the Petrifilm with battery power.

EWB has discoverd that by doing this locally rather than sending the films to a lab, we build trust with the local communities.

An EWB Austin member, Anjan Contractor, led the creation of an initial prototype.  However, it is fragile and undocumented.
This project intends to build a robust, cheap, easy-to-make, easy-to-use, well-documented extension of this prototype.

## Commercial Solutions

<p> Eric found the following potential commercial solutions:
[Compact Incubator](http://nelsonjameson.com/Compact-Incubator-p1298.html)  This is $94. We are trying to determine if this can be used with a 12 Volt battery. We may buy one for experimentation.

[Bigger Incubators](http://www.darwinchambers.com/Portable-Incubators.html)  These don't have prices listed.

## Notes from November 14th

After purchasing Compact Incubator mentioned above, we find it completely inadequate to our purposes.

We have, however, made signifcant progress in the design of an improved system.

Our basic approach was to purchase a smaller cooler: [http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IBWI42?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IBWI42?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00)
and place our Arduino-based system inside it, with the battery on the outside.
