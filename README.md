# The Armadillo v1.0, a Low-cost, Portable, Petrifilm Incubator

The Armadillo v1.0 is a low-cost, portable Petrifilm(TM) Incubator for doing in-country bacterial analysis of water quality for Engineers Without Borders.

## Start Here: Documentation

We have a press release in progress which is not yet published.

Our [instructable](http://www.instructables.com/id/Portable-Petrifilm-Incubator-for-Inexpensive-In-Fi/)
gives step-by-step instructions for the construction of the Armadillo for about $160.

For those who prefer printable and sharable PDF, we have prepared a [construction manual](https://github.com/EWB-Austin/petrifilm-incubator/blob/master/ConstructionManual.docx).

Because the use of the Armadillo requires inoculating Petrifilms, we have prepared an
[inoculation manual](https://github.com/EWB-Austin/petrifilm-incubator/blob/master/PetrifilmInoculation.pdf).

In the [experiments](https://github.com/EWB-Austin/petrifilm-incubator/tree/master/experiments) directory
you will find data from our battery-lifetime experiments.

## Status of the Project

We are:
* Preparing an academic paper with a plan to submit it to [Journal of Humanitarian Engineering](https://www.ewb.org.au/jhe/index.php/jhe).
* Planning some small improvements to create the Armadillo v2.0, such as the inclusion of a screwdriver and
a user manual in the Armadillo itself.
* Promoting the use and construction of the Aramadillo within EWB chapters.

## How You Can Help

We need someone to build an Armadillo!  Although we hope our published materials are self-sufficient,
we are happy to provide personal assistance and help in building your own Armadillo. We want to make
sure that our instruction materials are high-quality.
